For every input element, always provide name and value.
They are like key value pair.


1. OnSubmit to get the whole data

[...event.target].map( field => field.name/value/type)

event.target["nameOfAField"].value : this is also one way u can directly target a field

2. Handling data change.

always use onSubmit and onChange.

To get the final value and final validation : onSubmit
To keep sync of the data and realtime changes : onChange

In onChange, the input field that is being changed will be passed as event.
So u can take event.target.name : event.target.value and update the state of the form.
If some validation is wrong, then show that as well.


3. How to handle prepopulate of the form.
